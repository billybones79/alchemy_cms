<%#
  HTML structure and rendering of elements is done in
  frontend/app/views/spree/shared/_main_nav_bar.html.erb, so do nothing here
  in order for the editor preview to NOT duplicate the menu inside <article>.
  You'll end up with multiple elements having the same ID and broken links as
  a result.
